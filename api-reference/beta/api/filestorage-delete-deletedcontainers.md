# Remove deleted fileStorageContainer

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Permanently remove a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) from the deleted container collection. Removing a file storage container with this API permanently removes it from the deleted container collection. Therefore, it can't be restored later.

Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions).

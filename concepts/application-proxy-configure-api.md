#customer intent: As a developer, I want to configure Microsoft Entra application proxy programmatically using Microsoft Graph, so that I can automate the process of providing secure remote access and single sign-on to on-premises web applications for users.

# Configure Microsoft Entra application proxy using Microsoft Graph APIs

[Microsoft Entra application proxy](/entra/identity/app-proxy/overview-what-is-app-proxy) provides secure remote access and single sign-on (SSO) to on-premises web applications. It allows users to access their on-premises applications through an external URL, the My Apps portal, or other internal application portals.

In this tutorial, you learn how to Configure Microsoft Entra application proxy using Microsoft Graph APIs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app proxy-specific API operations are currently available only on the `beta` endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Install a connector and complete the [prerequisites](/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#prerequisites) for application proxy so that connectors can communicate with Microsoft Entra services.
- Sign in to an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) with an account that has at least the Cloud Application Administrator role.
- Grant yourself the Microsoft Graph `Directory.ReadWrite.All` delegated permission.
- Have a test user to assign to the application.

## Step 1: Create a custom application

To configure application proxy, you first create a custom application, and then update the app proxy settings in the application's **onPremisesPublishing** property. In this tutorial, you use an application template to create an instance of a custom application and service principal in your tenant. The template ID for a custom application is `8adf8e6e-67b2-4cf2-a259-e3dc5476c621`, which you can discover by running the following query: [GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applicationTemplates?$filter=displayName eq 'Custom'](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=applicationTemplates%3F%24filter%3DdisplayName%2Beq%2B'Custom'&method=GET&version=v1.0&GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com).

From the response, record the **id** of both the service principal and the application objects, and the value of **appId** for use later in the tutorial.

## Step 2: Configure application proxy

For the app that you created in Step 1, configure the URIs for the application. Assume that the app's internal URL is `https://contosoiwaapp.com` and the default domain for the external URL is `https://contosoiwaapp-contoso.msappproxy.net`. Add the external URL value to the **identifierUris**, **web>redirectUris** and **web>homePageUrl** properties. 

Also, configure the **onPremisesPublishing** property to set the internal and external URLs, and other properties as needed. This property is only available in `beta` and can't be configured until you configure the URIs.

### Step 2.1: Configure the URIs

The following request uses the value of **appId** for the **identifierUris** property. You can also use any other identifier that matches the application id URI format expected by Microsoft Entra ID. The request returns a `204 No content` response.

## Step 4: Configure single sign-on (SSO)

In this step, you configure the **onPremisesPublishing > singleSignOnSettings** and **onPremisesPublishing > singleSignOnMode** properties for the application.

### Option 1: Configure IWA-based SSO

The following request shows how to configure Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) for the application. The request returns a `204 No content` response.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

### Option 2: Configure header-based SSO

The following request shows how to configure header-based SSO for the application. In this mode, the value of the **singleSignOnMode** property can be `aadHeaderBased`, `pingHeaderBased`, or `oAuthToken`. The request returns a `204 No content` response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignore",
  "name": "tutorial_configure_appproxy_update_app_headerbased_sso"
}-->
```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/bf21f7e9-9d25-4da2-82ab-7fdd85049f83

{
  "onPremisesPublishing": {
    "singleSignOnSettings": {
      "kerberosSignOnSettings": {},
      "singleSignOnMode": "aadHeaderBased"
    }
  } 
}
```

## Step 5: Assign a user to the application

You want to assign a user to the application. From the service principal that you created in Step 1, record the ID of the default **User** role that's defined in the **appRoles** property. This value is `18d14569-c3bd-439b-9a66-3a2aee01d14f`.

In the request body, provide the following values:

- **principalId** - The ID of the user account that you created.
- **appRoleId** - The ID of the default `User` app role that you retrieved from the service principal.
- **resourceId** - The ID of the service principal.

## Step 6: Test access to the application

Test the application by visiting the **externalUrl** configured for the app on your browser and then sign in with your test user. You should be able to sign into the app and access the application.

## Step 7: Clean up resources

In this step, remove the resources that you created and no longer need.

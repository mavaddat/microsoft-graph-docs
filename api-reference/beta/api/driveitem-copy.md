# driveItem: copy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Asynchronously create a copy of a [driveItem][item-resource] (including any children) under a new parent item or with a new name. After the request is acknowledged, it enters a queue. The actual copying, including any subitems, occurs at an undetermined time. Progress is reported until the operation is completed by [monitoring the progress](/graph/long-running-actions-overview).

## Response

The response returns details about how to [monitor the progress](/graph/long-running-actions-overview) of the copy, upon accepting the request. The response indicates whether the copy operation was accepted or rejected - for example, if the destination filename is already in use.

## Examples

### Example 1: Copy a file to a folder

The following example copies a file identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The new copy of the file is named `contoso plan (copy).txt`.

### Example 2: Copy the children in a folder

The following example copies the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The `childrenOnly` parameter is set to true.

#### Response

The following example shows the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/4A3407B5-88FC-4504-8B21-0AABD3412717
```
Monitoring is important because the copy operation with childrenOnly occurs across multiple operations.

### Example 3: Copy the children in a folder with name conflict

The following example attempts to copy the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The destination already has the same name found at the source. The operation is accepted but it encounters a failure during processing.

#### Request
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "copy-item-3", "scopes": "files.readwrite", "target": "action" } -->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{item-id}/copy
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parentReference": {
    "driveId": "6F7D00BF-FC4D-4E62-9769-6AEA81F3A21B",
    "id": "DCD0D3AD-8989-4F23-A5A2-2C086050513F"
  }
}
```

#### Response

The following example shows the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->

Location: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/monitor/4A3407B5-88FC-4504-8B21-0AABD3412717
```

Follow the monitor url.
```http
{
  "id": "46cf980a-28e1-4623-b8d0-11fc5278efe6",
  "createdDateTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",

  "status": "failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "nameAlreadyExists",
    "message": "Name already exists"
  }
}
```
To resolve this error, use the optional query parameter [@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior](#optional-query-parameters).

### Example 4: Copy the children in a folder with name conflict setting conflictBehavior

The following example copies the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The optional query parameter @microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior is set to replace. The possible values are `replace`, `rename`, or `fail`.
The destination already has the same name found at the source.

#### Request
<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "copy-item-4", "scopes": "files.readwrite", "target": "action" } -->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{item-id}/copy?@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior=replace
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parentReference": {
    "driveId": "6F7D00BF-FC4D-4E62-9769-6AEA81F3A21B",
    "id": "DCD0D3AD-8989-4F23-A5A2-2C086050513F"
  }
}
```

```

### Example 5: Copy the children in a folder from root

The following example attempts to copy the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` (also known as root) into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The `childrenOnly` parameter isn't set to true.
The request fails because the copy operation can't be done in the root folder.

#### Request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "copy-item-5" } -->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/root/copy
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parentReference": {
    "driveId": "6F7D00BF-FC4D-4E62-9769-6AEA81F3A21B",
    "id": "DCD0D3AD-8989-4F23-A5A2-2C086050513F"
  }
}
```

#### Response

The following example shows the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 283

{
  "error":

      "client-request-id": "50a0er33-4567-3f6c-01bf-04d144fc8bbe"
    }
  }
}
```
To resolve this error, set the `childrenOnly` parameter to true.

### Example 6: Copy the children in a folder where source has more than 150 direct children

The following example attempts to copy the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The `childrenOnly` parameter is set to true. The drive item identified by `{item-id}` contains more than 150 direct children.
The request fails because the limit is 150 direct children.

#### Request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "copy-item-6" } -->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{item-id}/copy
Content-Type: application/json

{

    "driveId": "6F7D00BF-FC4D-4E62-9769-6AEA81F3A21B",
    "id": "DCD0D3AD-8989-4F23-A5A2-2C086050513F"
  }
}
```

#### Response

The following example shows the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 341

{
  "error":
  {
    "code": "invalidRequest",
    "message": "Direct child count limit exceeded. Cannot copy children only when there are more than 150 direct children.",
    "innerError":
    {
      "code": "directChildrenLimitExceeded",
      "date": "2023-12-11T04:26:35",
      "request-id": "8f897345980-f6f3-49dd-83a8-a3064eeecdf8",
      "client-request-id": "50a0er33-4567-3f6c-01bf-04d144fc8bbe"
    }
  }
}
```
To resolve this error, reorganize the source folder structure only to have 150 children.

### Example 7: Copy the children where the source item is a file

The following example attempts to copy the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The `{item-id}` refers to a file, not a folder. The `childrenOnly` parameter is set to true.
The request fails since the `{item-id}` is a nonfolder driveItem.

#### Request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "copy-item-7" } -->

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{item-id}/copy
Content-Type: application/json

    }
  }
}
```

### Example 8: Copy the children in a folder with childrenOnly and name

The following example attempts to copy the children in a folder identified by `{item-id}` into a folder identified with a `driveId` and `id` value.
The `childrenOnly` parameter is set to true and specify a `name` value.
The request fails because `childrenOnly` and `name` can't be used together.

#### Request

# What's new in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access data in Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. This article provides information about what's new in Microsoft Graph APIs, documentation, SDKs, and more.

For more detailed API-level updates, see the [Microsoft Graph API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/).

For details about previous updates to Microsoft Graph, see [Microsoft Graph what's new history](whats-new-earlier.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features in _preview_ status are subject to change without notice, and might not be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Don't use preview features in production apps.

## June 2024: New and generally available

### Change notifications

Enabled change notifications support to the methods to [list](/graph/api/subscription-list), [get](/graph/api/subscription-get), [create](/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions), [reauthorize](/graph/api/subscription-reauthorize), [update](/graph/api/subscription-update), and [delete](/graph/api/subscription-delete) a subscription for [offerShiftRequest](/graph/api/resources/offershiftrequest), [openShiftChangeRequest](/graph/api/resources/openshiftchangerequest), [shift](/graph/api/resources/shift), [swapShiftsChangeRequest](/graph/api/resources/swapshiftschangerequest), and [timeOffRequest](/graph/api/resources/timeoffrequest).

### Files

[Permanently delete](/graph/api/filestoragecontainer-permanentdelete) a [fileStorageContainer](/graph/api/resources/filestoragecontainer).

## June 2024: New in preview only

### Device and app management | Cloud PC

Use the **deviceRegionName** property on [cloudPC](/graph/api/resources/cloudpc?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to get the name of the geographical region where the Cloud PC is currently provisioned.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

- You can now control multifactor authentication (MFA) on an individual user basis, commonly referred to as per-user MFA on the Microsoft Entra admin center, by using the [authenticationMethod](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource and its associated methods.
- While [restoring soft-deleted users](/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-restore?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), you can now specify whether Microsoft Entra ID should autoreconcile conflicting proxy addresses if one or more of the soft-deleted user's proxy addresses are currently used for an active user.

### Identity and access | Network access

You can now enable and control compliant network check with Conditional Access through the Global Secure Access service by using the [compliantNetworkNamedLocation resource type](/graph/api/resources/compliantnetworknamedlocation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and its associated methods.

### Sites and lists

Added [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) support to sites. You can apply content models to SharePoint document libraries to classify and extract metadata from files. The new APIs enable you to do the following:

- Use [Get model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [Get model by name](/graph/api/contentmodel-getbyname?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) methods to get a [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. 
- Add a [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to a library by using the [add to drive](/graph/api/contentmodel-addtodrive?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method to make it ready to process files.
- Remove a [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) from a library by using the [remove from drive](/graph/api/contentmodel-removefromdrive?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method.
- Use [Get applied drives](/graph/api/contentmodel-getapplieddrives?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to list all libraries associated with the content model.

The content model automatically processes new files that are added to the libraries. You can create [document processing jobs](/graph/api/resources/documentprocessingjob?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to process existing files.

### Change notifications

Enabled change notifications support to the methods to [list](/graph/api/subscription-list?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [get](/graph/api/subscription-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [create](/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [reauthorize](/graph/api/subscription-reauthorize?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [update](/graph/api/subscription-update?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and [delete](/graph/api/subscription-delete?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a subscription for [offerShiftRequest](/graph/api/resources/offershiftrequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [openShiftChangeRequest](/graph/api/resources/openshiftchangerequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [shift](/graph/api/resources/shift?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [swapShiftsChangeRequest](/graph/api/resources/swapshiftschangerequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and [timeOffRequest](/graph/api/resources/timeoffrequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Device and app management | Cloud PC

[Assign a sensitivity label](/graph/api/plannerroster-assignsensitivitylabel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to a [plannerRoster](/graph/api/resources/plannerroster?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

## May 2024: New and generally available

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

Customize the authentication experience for your customers by using [user flows in Microsoft Entra External ID in external tenants](/graph/api/resources/authenticationEventsFlow). In the self-service sign-up user flow, you can collect user attributes, disable sign-up and only allow sign in, and also integrate with systems that are external to Microsoft Entra ID.

### Teamwork and communications | Calls and online meetings

Get the list of [callRecord](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-callrecord) objects and their properties and the associated [participant](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-participant) objects for each **callRecord** using the following APIs:

- [List callRecords](/graph/api/callrecords-cloudcommunications-list-callrecords)
- [List participants_v2](/graph/api/callrecords-callrecord-list-participants_v2)

The following properties are deprecated:

- **organizer** property on [callRecord](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-callrecord) in favor of the **organizer_v2** relationship.
- **participants** property on [callRecord](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-callrecord) in favor of the **participants_v2** relationship.
- **identity** property on [participantEndpoint](/graph/api/resources/callrecords-participantendpoint) in favor of the **associatedIdentity** property.

## May 2024: New in preview only
### Backup storage

The new Microsoft 365 Backup Storage API enables partners to build customized versions of their applications that are integrated with the Microsoft 365 Backup Storage platform. This helps to ensure exceptionally fast recovery from typical business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) scenarios, such as ransomware attacks or accidental/malicious deletion or overwriting of content by employees. To explore the API, see [Backup restore root](/graph/api/resources/backuprestoreroot?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Change notifications

- Enabled the `$notifyOnUserSpecificProperties` query parameter as a value of the **resource** property in the [subscription](/graph/api/resources/subscription?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. You can use the [notifyOnUserSpecificProperties](/graph/teams-changenotifications-chat#notification-payloads-for-user-specific-properties) parameter when you subscribe either to [user-scoped chat notifications](/graph/teams-changenotifications-chat#subscribe-to-changes-at-the-user-level-preview) or [notifications in a particular chat](/graph/teams-changenotifications-chat#subscribe-to-changes-in-a-particular-chat).

### Device and app management | Cloud PC

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

- Use the [externalAuthenticationMethodConfiguration resource type](/graph/api/resources/externalAuthenticationMethodConfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and its associated methods to manage the configuration of external authentication methods and define users who can use the external authentication methods to satisfy the second factor of Microsoft Entra ID multifactor authentication requirements.

# Identify and remediate risks by using identity protection APIs

Microsoft Entra ID Protection provides organizations insight into identity-based risk and different ways to investigate and automatically remediate risk. The Identity Protection APIs used in this tutorial can help you identify risk and configure a workflow to confirm compromise or enable remediation.

In this tutorial, you learn how to use identity protection APIs to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Generate a risky sign-in.
> * Allow users with risky sign-ins to remediate the risk status with a conditional access policy that requires multi-factor authentication (MFA).
> * Block a user from signing in using a conditional access policy.
> * Dismiss a user risk.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:

- A working Microsoft Entra tenant with a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license.
- Sign in to an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) with an account that has at least the *Conditional Access Administrator* role.
- Grant yourself the following delegated permissions: `IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All`, `IdentityRiskyUser.ReadWrite.All`, `Policy.Read.All`, `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess`, and `User.ReadWrite.All`.
- A test user account that you use to sign in later to an anonymous session to trigger a risk detection. You can use a private browsing session or the Tor browser. In this tutorial, the test user mail nickname is `MyTestUser1`.

## Step 1: Trigger a risk detection

In the anonymous browser session, sign in as **MyTestUser1** to **entra.microsoft.com**.

## Step 2: List risk detections

When **MyTestUser1** signed in to the Microsoft Entra admin center using the anonymous browser, an `anonymizedIPAddress` risk event was detected. You can use the `$filter` query parameter to get only the risk detections that are associated with the **MyTestUser1** user account. It might take a few minutes for the event to be returned.

    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Create a conditional access policy

You can use conditional access policies in your organization to allow users to self-remediate when risk is detected. Self-remediation enables your users to unblock themselves to access their resources securely after completing the policy prompt. In this step, you create a conditional access policy that requires the user to sign in using MFA if a medium or high risk detection occurs.

### Set up multifactor authentication

When setting up an account for MFA, you can choose from several methods for authenticating the user. Choose the best method for your situation to complete this tutorial. 

1. Sign in to the [keep your account secure](https://aka.ms/MFASetup) site using the **MyTestUser1** account.
2. Complete the MFA setup procedure using the appropriate method for your situation, such as using the Microsoft Authenticator app.

### Create the conditional access policy

The conditional access policy allows you to set the conditions of the policy to identify sign-in risk levels. Risk levels can be `low`, `medium`, `high`, `none`. The following example shows how to require MFA for sign ins with medium and high risk levels.

    ], 
    "customAuthenticationFactors": [], 
    "termsOfUse": [] 
  } 
} 
```

## Step 4: Trigger another risky sign in but complete multifactor authentication 

By signing in to the anonymous browser, a risk was detected, but you remediated it by completing MFA. 

Sign in to **entra.microsoft.com** using the **MyTestUser1** account and complete the MFA process. 

## Step 5: List risk detections

Rerun the request in Step 2 to get the latest risk detection for the **MyTestUser1** user account. Because MFA was completed in Step 4, the **riskState** for this latest sign in event is now `remediated`.

## [Optional] Block the user from signing in

Instead of providing the opportunity for the user to self-remediate, you can block the user who is associated with a risky sign in from signing in. In this step, you create a new conditional access policy that blocks the user from signing in if a medium or high risk detection occurs. The difference in between this policy and the preview policy in Step 3 is that the **builtInControls** is now set to `block`.

With this conditional access policy in place, **MyTestUser1** account is now blocked from signing in because the sign-in risk level is `medium` or `high`.

## Step 6: Dismiss risky users

If you believe the user isn't at risk, and you don't want to enforce a conditional access policy, you can manually dismiss the risky user. The request returns a `204 No Content` response.

After dismissing the risk user, you can rerun the request in Step 2 and will notice that the **MyTestUser1** user account now has a risk level of `none` and a riskState of `dismissed`.

## Step 7: Clean up resources

In this step, you delete the two conditional access policies that you created. The request returns a `204 No Content` response.

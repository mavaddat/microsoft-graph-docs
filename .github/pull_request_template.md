- **do not merge** is the default PR status and is automatically added to all open PRs that don't have the **ready to merge** label.
- Add the **ready for content review** label to start a review. Your PR won't be reviewed until you add this label.
- If your content reviewer requests changes, review the feedback and address accordingly as soon as possible to keep your pull request moving forward. After you address the feedback, remove the **changes requested** label, add the **review feedback addressed** label, and select the **Re-request review** icon next to the content reviewer's alias. If you can't add labels, add a comment with `#feedback-addressed` to the pull request.
- After the content review is complete, your reviewer will add the **content review complete** label. When the updates in this PR are ready for external customers to use, replace the **do not merge** label with **ready to merge** and the PR will be merged within 24 working hours.
- Pull requests that are inactive for more than 6 weeks will be automatically closed. Before that, you receive reminders at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks. If you still need the PR, you can reopen or recreate the request.

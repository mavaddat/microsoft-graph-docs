# Manage Microsoft Entra applications and service principals by using Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Entra ID is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. A core part of its functionality is the [Microsoft identity platform](/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview), which provides authentication and authorization services for *registered applications*. Microsoft Graph APIs allow you to register and manage your applications programmatically, enabling you to use Microsoft's IAM capabilities.

## Applications and service principals

In Microsoft Entra, an application is defined by an **application** object and a **service principal** object. There's only one application object for your application across Microsoft Entra, but there can be multiple service principal objects for your application. 

The application object is located in the tenant where the app was registered. A service principal is created in every tenant where the app is installed and used, including the tenant where the app is registered. For more information, see [Application and service principal objects in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals).

In Microsoft Graph, an application is represented by the [application resource type](application.md) and a service principal is represented by the [servicePrincipal resource type](serviceprincipal.md). The details of the two objects can be accessed on the Microsoft Entra admin center through the **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications** menus respectively.

## API use cases for managing applications

The following API use cases are supported for managing applications through the [application resource type](../resources/application.md) in Microsoft Graph.

| Use cases | API operations |
|--|--|
| Register service principal | [Create servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-post-serviceprincipals.md) |

## Application templates

Application templates are apps that are available in the [Microsoft Entra app gallery](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/overview-application-gallery). Use the [applicationTemplate resource type and its associated methods](../resources/applicationtemplate.md) to:

- Identify apps from the application gallery
- Identify apps by the SSO mode they support
- Instantiate an app and service principal from an application gallery

## Policies applicable to applications and service principals

## Identity synchronization (provisioning)

Provisioning APIs in Microsoft Graph allow you to automate and manage the provisioning and deprovisioning of identities in the following scenarios:

- From your on-premises Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID
- From other cloud directories to Microsoft Entra ID
- From Microsoft Entra ID to cloud applications such as Dropbox, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and more

For more information, see [Microsoft Entra synchronization API overview](../resources/synchronization-overview.md).

## On-premises publishing and app proxy

On-premises publishing and application proxy allows you to access on-premises resources securely from the internet, and also use Microsoft Entra-supported capabilities like single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication, Conditional Access, and two-step verification.

For more information, see [On-premises publishing profiles](/graph/api/resources/onpremisespublishingprofile-root).

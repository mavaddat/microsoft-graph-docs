# Add members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a member to a security or Microsoft 365 group. When using the API to add multiple members in one request, you can add up to only 20 members. 

[!INCLUDE [groups-allowed-member-types](../../../concepts/includes/groups-allowed-member-types.md)]

## Permissions

The following table shows the least privileged permission that's required by each resource type when calling this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource                        | Delegated (work or school account)                      | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application                                             |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| [device](../resources/device.md)          | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Device.ReadWrite.All      | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Device.ReadWrite.All      |
| [group](../resources/group.md)            | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All                               | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All       |
| [orgContact](../resources/device.md)      | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and OrgContact.Read.All       | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and OrgContact.Read.All       |
| [servicePrincipal](../resources/group.md) | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Application.ReadWrite.All | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All and Application.ReadWrite.All |
| [user](../resources/user.md)              | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All                               | Not supported.                         | GroupMember.ReadWrite.All                               |

In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/groups/members/update` role permission. The following roles are the least privileged roles that are supported for this operation, except for role-assignable groups:

- Group owners
- Directory Writers
- Groups Administrator
- Identity Governance Administrator
- User Administrator
- Exchange Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
- SharePoint Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
- Teams Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
- Yammer Administrator - only for Microsoft 365 groups
- Intune Administrator - only for security groups

To add members to a role-assignable group, the app must also be assigned the *RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory* permission and the calling user must be assigned a supported Microsoft Entra role. *Privileged Role Administrator* is the least privileged role that is supported for this operation.

# channel: archive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Archive a [channel](../resources/channel.md) in a team. When a channel is archived, users can't send new messages or react to existing messages in the channel, edit the channel settings, or make other changes to the channel.

You can delete an archived channel, or add and remove members from it. If you archive a team, its channels are archived for you.

Archiving is asynchronous; a channel is archived after the asynchronous archiving operation completes successfully, which might occur after the response returns.

A channel without an owner, or that belongs to a [group](../resources/group.md) that has no owner, can't be archived.

To restore a channel from its archived state, use the [unarchive](channel-unarchive.md) method. A channel canâ€™t be archived or unarchived if its team is archived.

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}/archive
POST /groups/{team-id}/team/channels/{channel-id}/archive
```

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body

In the request, you can optionally include the `shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers` parameter in a JSON body, as follows.
```JSON
{
    "shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers": true
}
```
This optional parameter defines whether to set permissions for channel members to read-only on the SharePoint Online site associated with the team. Setting it to false or omitting the body altogether results in this step being skipped.

## Response

If archiving is started successfully, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response contains a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md) that was created to handle archiving of the channel in a team. Check the status of the archiving operation by making a GET request to this location.

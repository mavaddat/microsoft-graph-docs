# Working with the authentication methods usage report API

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The authentication methods usage reports help you understand how users in your organization are using Microsoft Entra authentication capabilities such as multifactor authentication (MFA), Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), and Passwordless authentication.

These reports provide information such as:

- How many users are registered for each authentication method
- How many users are registered for features such as multifactor authentication (MFA), Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), and Passwordless authentication.
- The failure rates of each authentication method

A Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license is required to access usage and insights. Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and self-service password reset (SSPR) licensing information can be found on the [Microsoft Entra pricing site](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
